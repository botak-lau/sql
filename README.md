sql assessment

(1) What did you like about this project?
I'm glad it's code academy in that there are hints under each question. Helps us focus on finding the usage of the function, although the hint from question 4 was not very helpful.

It's a good practice too cos there were quite a few things we didn't cover in class.


What did you struggle with in this project?
Question 4 took the most time. Conceptually, I knew how to go about getting the data but it was the search for th functions that took a long time. Search for the right function to take multiple conditions in a query was difficult. Even when I found that CASE can do it, getting the syntax and structure right took a bit of time. Too many answers in stackoverflow which can be very confusing.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I think it would have been great if we had been able to do this in My SQL Workbench. Cos the SQL lessons have been short and we just started learning the package yesterday and to then dive into a new one was a tad challenging. In my practice session, I found it extremely helpful to read the error messages whereas, Code Academy just give me a blank screen when there's error! Quite frustrating.
