sql assessment

(1) What did you like about this project?
I'm glad it's code academy in that there were hints under each question. Helped me focus on finding the usage of the function, although the hint from question 4 was not very helpful.

It's a good practice too cos there were quite a few things we didn't cover in class.


(2) What did you struggle with in this project?
Question 4 took the most time. The easy way was to run one query with one condition but and get the answer but that's too clumsy an approach. Conceptually, I knew how to go about getting the data but it was the search for the right function that took a long time. Search for the right function to take multiple conditions in a query was difficult. Even when I found that CASE can do it, getting the syntax and structure right took a bit of time and especially frustrating when there's no error messages to guide us like MySQL Workbench. Too many answers in stackoverflow with different syntax and approach can be very confusing.


(3) What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I think it would have been great if we had been able to do this in My SQL Workbench. Cos the SQL lessons have been short and we just started learning the package yesterday and to then dive into a new one was a tad challenging. In my practice session, I found it extremely helpful to read the error messages whereas, Code Academy just gave me a blank screen when there's error! Quite frustrating.
